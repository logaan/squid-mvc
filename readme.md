## Dependencies

Known to work with
Java 1.8.0_25
npm 2.10.1

Should work with any fairly recent version of either.

## Getting started

    ./scripts/npm-install
    ./scripts/figwheel

`npm-install` will pull down the static assets used for styling the TodoMVC
template.

`figwheel` will install Leiningen (the defacto standard ClojureScript build
tool) which will in turn install all remaining Clojurescript dependencies.

## Development

    ./scripts/figwheel

This will start a repl and open a browser window pointing to the application.
Code written in the repl will run in the browser window.
